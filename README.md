This Application is built for Small Businesses. <br/><br/>
It lets you enter a Bill amount and cash given by the customer so you can quickly give the return amount back to the customer in minimum number of notes possible.

### Bonus:
  You can also add/delete a note if you don't like our selection of Notes.
  > Steps to do this are as such:
  1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/tushartiwari7/neogcamp) and open in your preferred IDE
  2. head over to: `markten\src\Utils\notes.js`
  3. then edit `notes.js` by adding /deleting the note value you want
      * for example if you wish to add 1000 then do this:
        ``` 
        ...
        2000,
        1000,
        500,
        ...
        ```
  4. Save it and head to `markten` in your terminal
  5. now run `npm install` in it
  >> this will install all the required packages needed to run this app.
  6. Now just run `npm start` once.
  >> this will start your app in development mode in `localhost:3000`
  7. That's it, now you can run this application with your custom changes on your local machine.
